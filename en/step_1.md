## Introduction

In this project you will analyse real data, captured by either of the two Astro Pi Flight Units onboard the International Space Station, to learn about Life in Space and Life.

You will:
- Load [Comma Separated Values (CSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) into a spreadsheet application.
- Display the loaded data in a graphical format.
- Look for anomalies in the data, and try to form rational conclusions about those data points.
