## What to do when you find something

We'll be trying to collectively map out what we think was happening throughout the entire time the flight recorder mode was active. To contribute to this, please go to the [Astro Pi forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=104) and write a new post explaining your findings. This will then be verified by one of the team at Raspberry Pi and other members of the public.

Good luck!
