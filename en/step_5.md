## What next?

Have a play with your own Sense HAT to experiment with collecting data, saving it to a CSV file and then analysing the data.

You can try and find some patterns or anomalies in the data from the flight unit you downloaded earlier.

If you are following the Life in Space pathway, you can plan an experiment to run on the ISS, to look at the environmental conditions in space.
